- This project is completely wrong because it works like this:
    1 - read source into buff // Correct
    2 - lexical analyze the source // Correct
    3 - parse and as u parse u evaluate... // which is wrong >_<
PROB:
    The problem now is that the kasper interpreter does not parse things correctly,
    I need to make an ast tree. then pass the tree into the evalualtor to execute the code.

TODO:
    [] Learn recursive descent parsing.
    [] make a simple recursive descent parser.
    [] make an evaluator.

GOAL:
    ... (idk `:(` )
